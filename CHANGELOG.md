#RPY-PDF Changelog

#### v0.6.0
- Added unicode support
	* Still dislikes ellipses, but accentuations work now.
- Can now output to .TXT as well as .PDF
- PDF support complete and will be unsupported in future versions.

- Software now entirely customizable via configurable text files.
- Bug list:
	* No distinguishment between scenes/chapters
	* Haven't checked to see what strings are removed, in case some important ones are.

#### v0.5.0

	* No configuration possible to the page layout
		+ i.e. still has hard-coded fonts, etc.
